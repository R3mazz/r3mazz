# Privacy Policy for ParkenUlm for iOS

We take the protection of your data very seriously and are committed to
protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we collect and
use personal data in our iOS app.

Our iOS app uses data obtained from
[parken-in-ulm.de](https://www.parken-in-ulm.de/) to provide information
within the app. However, we do not collect any personal data when you
use our iOS app. We do not collect your name, email address, or phone
number. In version `1.2.3` and later, we collect anonymous usage data to improve the app and its features. You can disable this data collection in the app settings. You can find more information about that down below.

Our iOS app does not use any third-party technologies to collect or
track data about you. We also do not use tracking tools like cookies or
similar technologies to gather information about your activities.

If you send us an email or contact us through the app's contact form, we
will only use your email address and any other information you provide
to respond to your inquiry. We do not store your data longer than
necessary and do not share it with third parties.

In compliance with Apple's privacy policies, certain information about
your usage of our app is automatically collected, such as information
about crashes and app usage history. This information is anonymized and
is only used to improve the app and fix errors.

We respect the privacy policies of
[parken-in-ulm.de](https://www.parken-in-ulm.de/) and only collect data
that is publicly available. We do not store this data longer than
necessary.

If you have any questions about our privacy policy or our iOS app,
please contact us by [email](mailto:bircni@icloud.com).

We reserve the right to update this privacy policy at any time.

Starting with version `1.2.3`, the iOS app uses the Aptabase Dependency
to collect anonymous usage data. This data is used to improve the app
and its features and to fix errors. To get more information about the Aptabase
Dependency, please have a look at the [Aptabase Privacy Policy](https://aptabase.com/legal/privacy).
